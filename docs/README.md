# Quake-DFN

Version 2.0  

Quake-DFN is the boundary element simulator developed for earthquake rupture simulation of discretely distributed faults governed by rate and state friction law. The simulator formulation is consistent with the widely used quasi-dynamic formulation with radiation damping but with a lumped mass representing overshoot effects.

Distributed Discretization
Time Step Optimization
User Interface Change

Installation Guide:  To be updated

Example Simulations: To be updated

Complex geometry with triangular Meshing: To be updated

Cuboid Reservoir Coupling: To be Updated

To use, (1) clone the repository (or download the file) and (2) follow the installation guide. It is strongly recommended to follow the example simulations video if you have any plans to use this code. This is the best way to understand and test the code.
