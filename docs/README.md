# Quake-DFN V. 2.0

Quake-DFN is the boundary element simulator developed for earthquake rupture simulation of discretely distributed faults governed by rate and state friction law. The simulator is coded with a quasi-dynamic formulation with radiation damping and a lumped mass.

New Feature in V. 2.0:
- Triangular Meshing
- Distributed Discretization
- Time Step Optimization
- User Interface Change
